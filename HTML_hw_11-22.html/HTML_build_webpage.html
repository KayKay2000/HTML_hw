    <p style="text-align:center;">When searching for a new canine pet, many families research breeders to get a full bred puppy. Although there is nothing wrong with that, there are millions of dogs available for adoption.
    Here are some facts from the ASPCA:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>According to the ASPCA, <strong>3.1 million</strong> dogs enter an animal shelter annually.</li>
    <li> Approximately <strong>390,000</strong> dogs are euthanized annually.</li>
    <li> Approximately <strong>2 million</strong> dogs are adopted each year.</li>
    <li> About <strong>710,000</strong> stray dogs are returned to their owner</li>
    <li> About <strong>60%</strong> of shelter dogs are euthanized each year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief not all dogs in animal shelters and rescue organizations have behavioral problems.
    Many times, people have to leave their pet(s) behind due to a relocation. Some rescue organizations also train 
    dogs to help them get adopted quicker. Here are some facts about dogs in general and dog adoption:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adopting from a shelter or rescue organization is cheaper than buying from a breeder.</li>
        <li>Adopting helps the rescue or shelter keep rescuing other animals</li>
        <li>Owning a dop helps you live longer compared to not having a dog</li>
        <li>Not all rescue dogs are mutts, some are actually purebred</li>
        <li>You might get a dog who's very unique and mixed with many types of dogs.</li>
        <li>Rescue organizations and animal shelters actually have puppies</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are many animal shelters and dog rescues around the metro Atlanta area. I visited a few animal shelters before 
    getting a dog. I went to the Atlanta Humane Society and got this little dude 3 years ago:
